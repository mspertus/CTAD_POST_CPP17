<h1>Filling holes in Class Template Argument Deduction</h1>
This paper proposes filling several gaps in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0091r3.html">Class Template Argument Deduction</a>.
<h2>Rationale</h2>
As Timur Doumler has noted when giving public presentations on using CTAD, he has to end the presentations with a list of where CTAD cannot be used, which always
	deflates the positive feelings from the rest of the talk because it is accurately regarded as artificially inconsistent. In particular, listeners are invariably surprised that it does not work with aggregate templates, type aliases, inherited constructors, or obey normal rules for calling function templates.
    We will show in this paper
that these limitations can be safely removed. Note that any of these items were intentionally deferred to
    C++17 with the intent of adding them in C++20.  <p>The following example (which also includes
    notation from
    <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1141r0.html">P1141R0</a>
    <a href="#tf" name="f">*</a>) gives an idea of how much filling holes can smooth the road. 

<table border="1"><tr><th>C++17 + P1141R0</th><th>Proposed</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre class="brush:cpp">void f(Curve auto c) {
  Point&lt;decltype(c.x_min())&gt; top_left{c.x_min(), c.y_max()};
  pmr::vector&lt;typename decltype(c.ctrl_pts)::value_type&gt; v(c.ctrl_pts.begin(), c.ctr_pts.end());
  /* ... */
}</pre></td>
<td><pre class="brush:cpp">void f(Curve auto c) {
  Point upper_left_bound{c.x_min(), c.y_max()};
  pmr::vector v(c.ctrl_pts.begin(), c.ctr_pts.end());
  /* ... */
} </pre></td></tr></table>
 To see that this really falls under the category of filling holes, the above code would work in C++17
if we just gave <tt>Point</tt> a two argument constructor corresponding to aggregate initialization
and used <tt>vector</tt> instead of <tt>pmr::vector</tt>.
<p>
To give a &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; example, Mateusz Pusz recently 
    approached us about his unit library <a href="https://github.com/mpusz/units">Physical Units library</a>,
    asking why code like the following in his library did not deduce as expected
    <blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;Dimension D, Unit U, typename Rep&gt; class quantity;
template&lt;Dimension D, Unit U, typename Rep&gt; quantity(Rep r) -> quantity&lt;D, U, Rep&gt;;

template&lt;Unit U = meter, typename Rep = intmax_t&gt;
using length = quantity&lt;dimension_length, U, Rep&gt;;

length d1(3);                 // 3 meters
length d2(3.14);              // 3.14 meters
length&lt;mile&gt; d3(3);           // 3 miles
length&lt;mile&gt; d4(3.14);        // 3.14 miles
length&lt;mile, float&gt; d3(3.14); // 3.14 miles as float
</pre></blockquote>
 We were pleased to discover on examination that the  
    proposals in this paper for alias templates, partial
template argument lists, and rules for aligning deduction guides with defaulted template
parameters would have allowed the above code to work just as expected.

<h2>Class Template Argument Deduction for aggregates</h2>
We propose that Class Template Argument Deduction works for aggregate initialization as one
	shouldn't have to choose between having aggregates and deduction. This is well illustrated
	by the following example, where <tt>v</tt> is a vector of (some specialization of) <tt>Point</tt> 
	and <tt>f()</tt> returns a vector of (some specialization of) <tt>Point</tt>:
<table border="1"><tr><th>C++17</th><th>Proposed</th></tr>
<td><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;class T&gt;
struct Point { T x; T y};

// Aggregate: Cannot deduce
Point&lt;double&gt; p{3.0, 4.0};
Point&lt;double&gt; p2 {.x = 3.0, .y = 4.0};
Point&lt;decltype(v[0].x)&gt; p3 = v[0];
Point&lt;/*????*/&gt; p4 = f()[0];</pre>
</td>    
    <td><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;class T&gt;
struct Point { T x; T y};

// Proposed: Aggregates deduce
Point p{3.0, 4.0};
Point p2 {.x = 3.0, .y = 4.0};
Point p3 = v[0];
Point p4 = f()[0];
</pre></td>
    </table>

In other words, deduction should take place simply from the arguments. Since it was voted in Rapperswil that aggregate
    initialization proceed as if there was a synthesized constructor (does this apply to designated initializers and list-initialization?), we simply propose that the synthesized constructors have associated implicit deduction guides the same as other constructors do.

<h2>Class Template Argument Deduction for alias templates</h2>
While Class Template Argument Deduction makes type inferencing easier when constructing classes,
it doesn't work for type aliases, penalizing the use of type aliases and creating unnecessary inconsistency.We propose allowing Class Template Argument Deduction for type aliases as in the following example.

    <table border="1"><tr><th><tt>vector</tt></th><th><tt>pmr::vector</tt> (C++17)</th><th>pmr::vector (proposed)</th></tr>
<tr>
    <td>
<pre class="brush:cpp">vector v = {1, 2, 3};
vector v2(cont.begin(), cont.end());</pre>
    </td>
    <td><pre class="brush:cpp">pmr::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 2, 3};
pmr::vector&lt;decltype(cont)::value_type&gt; v2(cont.begin(), cont.end());</pre>
    </td>
<td><pre class="brush:cpp">pmr::vector v = {1, 2, 3};
pmr::vector v2(cont.begin(), cont.end());</pre>
</td>
</tr></table>
    <tt>pmr::vector</tt> also serves to illustrate another interesting case. While one might
    be tempted to write
    <blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">pmr::vector pv({1, 2, 3}, mem_res); // Ill-formed (C++17 and proposed)</pre></blockquote>
    this example is ill-formed by the normal rules of template argument deduction because
    <tt>pmr::memory_resource</tt> fails to 
    deduce <tt>pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;int&gt;</tt> in the  second argument. 
    <p>While this is to be expected, one suspects that had class template argument deduction
        for alias templates been around when <tt>pmr::vector</tt> was being designed,
        the committee would have considered allowing such an inference as safe and useful in this context.
        If that was desired, it could easily have been achieved 
        by indicating that the <code>pmr::allocator</code> template parameter should be considered non-deducible:
    <blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">namespace pmr {
  template&lt;typename T&gt;
  using vector = std::vector&lt;T, identity_t&lt;pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;; // See p0887R0 for identity_t
}
pmr::vector pv({1, 2, 3}, mem_res); // OK with this definition</pre></blockquote>
 Finally, in the spirit of alias templates being simply an alias for the type, we do not propose
allowing the programmer to write explicit deduction guides specifically for an alias
template.
<h3>Algorithm</h3>
For deriving deduction guides for the alias templates from guides in the class, we use the following approach (for which we are very grateful for the invaluable assistance of Richard Smith):
<ol><li>Deduce template parameters for the deduction guide by deducing the right hand side of
    the deduction guide from the alias template. We do not require that this deduces all the template
    parameters as nondeducible contexts may of course occur in general</li>
    <li>Substitute any deductions made back into the deduction guides. Since the previous step may not
    have deduced all template parameters of the deduction guide, the new guide may have template
    parameters from both the type alias and the original deduction guide.</li>
    <li>Derive the corresponding deduction guide for the alias template by 
    deducing the alias from the result type. Note that a constraint may be necessary
    as whether and how to deduce the alias from the result type may depend on the
    actual argument types.</li>
    <li>The guide generated from the copy deduction guide should be given
    the precedence associated with copy deduction guides during overload resolution</li></ol>
Let us illustrate this process with an example. Consider the following example:
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;class T&gt; using P = pair&lt;int, T&gt;;</pre></blockquote>
Naively using the deduction guides from pair is not ideal because they
    cannot necessarily deduce objects of type <tt>P</tt> even
    from arguments that should obviously work, like <tt>P({}, 0)</tt>. However,
    let us apply the above procedure. The relevant deduction guide is
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;class A, class B&gt; pair(A, B) -&gt; pair&lt;A, B&gt;</pre></blockquote>
Deducing <code>(A, B)</code> from <code>(int, T)</code> yield <code>int</code> for <code>A</code>
    and <code>T</code> for <code>B</code>. Now substitute back into the deduction guide to get
    a new deduction guide
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;class T&gt; pair(int, T) -&gt; pair&lt;int, T&gt;;</pre></blockquote>
Deducing the template arguments for the alias template from this gives us the following deduction guide for the alias template 
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">template&lt;class T&gt; P(int, T) -&gt; P&lt;T&gt;;</pre></blockquote>
A repository of additional expository materials and worked out examples used in the refinement of this algorithm 
    is maintained <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mspertus/CTAD_POST_CPP17/master/CTAD_alias_examples.html">online</a>.
<h2>Deducing from inherited constructors</h2>
In C++17, deduction guides (implicit and explicit) are not inherited when constructors are inherited.
	According to the C++ Core Guidelines <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-inheriting">C.52</a>, you should &ldquo;use inheriting constructors to import constructors into a derived class that does not need further explicit initialization&rdquo;. As the creator of such a thin wrapper has not asked in any way for the derived class to behave differently under construction, our experience is that users are
surprised that construction behavior changes:
<table border="1"><tr><td colspan="2">
<pre class="brush:cpp">template &lt;typename T&gt; struct CallObserver requires Invocable&lt;T&gt; { 
  CallObserver(T &amp;&amp;) : t(std::forward&lt;T&gt;(t)) {}
  virtual void observeCall() { t(); }
  T t;
};

template &lt;typename T&gt; struct CallLogger : public CallObserver&lt;T&gt; { 
  using CallObserver&lt;T&gt;::CallObserver; 
  virtual void observeCall() override { cout &lt;&lt; "calling"; t();  }
};</pre>
</td></tr>
<tr><th>C++17</th> <th>Proposed</th></tr>
<tr><td>
	<pre class="brush:cpp">CallObserver b([]() { /* ... */ }); // OK
CallLogger&lt;/*????*/&gt; d([]() { /* ... */ });</pre>
</td>
<td><pre class="brush:cpp">CallObserver b([]() { /* ... */ }); // OK
Derived d([]() { /* ... */ }); // Now OK</pre>
    </td></tr></table>
Note that inheriting the constructors of a base class must include inheriting all the deduction guides, not just the implicit ones. As a number of standard library
writers use explicit guides to behave &ldquo;as-if&rdquo; their classes were defined as in the standard, such internal implementation details
details would become visible if only the internal guides were inherited. We of course use the same algorithm
    for determining deduction guides for the base class template as described above for alias templates.

<h2>Class Template Argument Deduction and partial template argument lists</h2>
    Partial template argument lists can be given in Function Template Argument Deduction
    but surprisingly fail in Class Template Argument Deduction, a restriction we propose removing.
    Not only is this more consistent, but it has powerful applications that resolve longstanding
    difficulties in C++, such as creating associative containers with lambda comparators, as the following 
    example shows.
    <table border="1"><tr><th>C++17</th><th>Proposed</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre class="brush:cpp">using namespace ba = boost::algorithm;

set&lt;string, ba::ilexicographic_compare&gt; case_insensitive_strings(ba::ilexicographic_compare);

// Lambda comparators are great for algorithms like sort
// Why can't we use them for associative containers?
set&lt;int, /* ???? */&gt; s([](int i, int j) { 
                          return std::popcount(i) &lt; std::popcount(j); 
                     }); 

// Or container adaptors?
priority_queue&lt;Task, vector&lt;Task&gt;, /* ???? */&gt; tasks([](Task a, Task b) {
                                                     return a.priority &lt; b.priority;
                                                   }); </pre>
    </td>
<td><pre class="brush:cpp">using namespace ba = boost::algorithm;

set&lt;string&gt; case_insensitive_strings(ba::ilexicographic_compare);

// Lambda comparators are great for algorithms like sort
// Now with associative containers, too!
set&lt;int&gt; s([](int i, int j) { 
              return std::popcount(i) &lt; std::popcount(j);
            }); 

// and container adaptors!
priority_queue&lt;Task&gt; tasks([](Task a, Task b) { 
                              return a.priority &lt; b.priority;
                         });</pre></td></tr></table>   

<h3>Technical considerations</h3>
    The above discussion naturally begs the question as to why partial template
    argument lists in Class Template Argument Discussion were not supported from the beginning. This feature
    was deferred in C++17 out of concern that it could result in breaking changes when partially
    template argument lists were combined with default arguments or variadic templates. 
<h4>Default arguments</h4>
Consider the expression
    <blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">vector&lt;int&gt;(MyAlloc())</pre></blockquote>
As far back as C++98, this creates a <tt>vector&lt;int, allocator&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt>,
    although it is unlikely to compile because <tt>MyAlloc</tt> almost certainly is not
    convertible to <tt>allocator&lt;int&gt;</tt>. By contrast, ordinary function template
    argument deduction would of course deduce <tt>vector&lt;int, MyAlloc&gt;</tt>.
    While this is exactly what we would want in this situation and is likely
    what we would have done if Class Template Argument Deduction was in C++ from the 
    beginning, we would now have to contend with it being a breaking change.
	<p>Fortunately, we can get the benefit of the usual Function Template Argument Deduction without breaking existing code by the following rule:
		<ul><li>If a class has no explicit deduction guides, we propose that C++17 behavior applies where default template
        arguments override type inference.  If the class has explicit 
        guides, then inference overrides default arguments as in normal Function Template Argument Deduction.</li></ul> 
	
	This maintains the behavior of legacy C++ for classes that 
        were designed before Class Template Argument Deduction was introduced, while at the same time allowing
	important examples like the above to be handled correctly (assuming <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mspertus/CTAD_POST_CPP17/blob/master/P1069R0.html">P1069R0</a>, which we believe is certainly desirable. Of course, once a class has
	deduction guides, nearly any desired behavior can be specified, so other examples should be handleable as needed.<p>
 <b>Notes:</b><ul><li>As this rule is only relevant for template parameters with default initializers. For class template
	parameters without default initializers, the programmer can ignore it.</li>
	<li>Without this rule, no combination of traditional deduction guides could produce this behavior, severely
	limiting the ability to use deduction guides to customize class behavior.</li>
	<li>If  deduction guides are ever supported for function templates in addition to class templates as 
		proposed in <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mspertus/CTAD_POST_CPP17/blob/master/D1168R0.html">D1168R0</a>,
	having deduction guides follow the usual rules for function template argument deduction in which inference overrides default values
		seems clearly the right approach. This proposal will be consistent with that.</li></ul>
<h4>Variadic arguments</h4>
<p>One other technical issue discussed during C++17 was around variadic templates. In particular, what should <tt>tuple&lt;int&gt;(1, 2.3)</tt> deduce?
Again, the C++17 behavior of <tt>tuple&lt;int&gt;</tt> is incorrect, as such templates have the wrong number of arguments. While it
is tempting to deduce additional arguments just like <tt>make_tuple&lt;int&gt;(1, 2.3)</tt> does, we do not propose at this time allowing additional
	variadic arguments to be deduced for the following reasons:
<ul><li>The following code is both valid and useful in C++17
	<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">tuple&lt;int&gt; t(5, allocator&lt;int&gt;());</pre></blockquote>
	However, if additional variadic arguments were deduced, this code would erroneously deduce <tt>tuple&lt;int, allocator&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt>,
	introducing a breaking change.</li>
<li>Since programmers are used to thinking of <tt>tuple&lt;int&gt;</tt> as the name of a type, allowing it to
	deduce to the very different type tuple&lt;int, allocator&lt;int&gt;&gt;</li> might well be confusing.
	<li>We are not aware of any truly compelling use cases for deducing extra variadic arguments on
	a par with the ones listed above, so the downsides outweigh the benefits in our opinion.</li></ul>
<b>Note:</b>
<blockquote>If at some point in the future it is desired to align more closely with function templates
	by allowing additional variadic arguments to be deduced, it may become possible with other related language changes.
	For example, if the right-hand side of a deduction guide could be a <em>type-id</em> instead of just
	a <em>simple-template-id</em>, a  metafunction could compute the deduce different <tt>tuple</tt> types based on
	whether the last argument is an allocator as well as unrelated use cases such as Richard Smith's delayed forwarding example
	in P1021R0, but as there is absolutely no requirement that this be considered for C++20, so we do not pursue this
	any further at this time.</blockquote>
