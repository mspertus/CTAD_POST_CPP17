<h1>Why Class Template Argument Deduction will make Terse Notation better</h1>
Terse concept notation along the lines of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1141r0.html">P1141R0</a> has
the potential to powerfully make generic programming look more like &ldquo;regular
programming&rdquo;. This paper discusses how Class Template Argument
Deduction can help make the release of terse notation as successful as
possible by providing inferenced creation of constrained objects
just as concepts provide inferenced usage of constrained objects
as illustrated by the following example (note that <tt>Curve</tt> is a concept).
<table border="1"><tr><th>C++17 + P1141R0</th><th>Proposed</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<pre class="brush:cpp">auto f(Curve auto &amp;c)
  -&gt; pair&lt;decltype(c), pmr::vector&lt;typename decltype(c.ctrl_pts)::value_type&gt;&gt;

  Point&lt;decltype(c.x_min())&gt; top_left{c.x_min(), c.y_max()};
  screen->line&lt;decltype(p.x)&gt;(p, {c.x_min(), c.y_max()});
  pmr::vector&lt;typename decltype(c.ctrl_pts)::value_type&gt; cp(c.ctrl_pts.begin(), c.ctrl_pts.end(), mem_res);
  return {c, cp };
};</pre></td>
<td valign="top">

  Point top_left{c.x_min(), c.y_max()};
  screen->line(top_left, {c.x_min(), c.y_max()});
  pmr::vector cp(c.ctrl_pts.begin(), c.ctrl_pts.end(), mem_res);
  return {c, cp};

What is going on here? Terse notation has many benefits because it
allows us to prefer interface/behavior over implementation when
using objects, with all the well-known benefits associated thereto.
This is a very good thing, but, like everything, has a few tradeoffs.
In particular, it is more common to have named objects without
named types. The main use of course for concrete types is for object
creation, where an actual type, rather than just the requirements it
satisfies, needs to be specified somehow. Class Template Argument Deduction 
is a way to create new objects from existing objects where the new
type is inferred, rather than needing to be explicitly stated, which
is just what the doctor ordered for flexible and robust code in examples
such as the above.
<p>While C++17 Class Template Argument Deduction can often be
used in such situations (e.g., if the <tt>pmr::vector</tt> above
had been an ordinary <tt>vector</tt>), the example above
was crafted to illustrate the value of potential improvements
to Class Template Argument Deduction, such as return type
deduction below, and aggregate and type alias deduction from P1021R1.
<h2>The proposal</h2>
Our proposal is simply that wherever P1141R0 allows a Concept-constrained
<tt>auto</tt>, a class template can be used as well with the same
	rules for independent resolution and forwarding references. Let
	us look at some examples.
<h3>Ordinary declarations</h3>
In P1141R0, it is mentioned that in
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">Constraint auto f1();</pre></blockquote>
it should be possible to omit the <tt>auto</tt> to get
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">Constraint f1();</pre></blockquote>
As justification, P1141R0 specifically refers to Class Template Argument Deduction allowing

<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">std::tuple x = foo();</pre></blockquote>
By the same reasoning, it makes sense for us to be consistent in the other
direction and allow

<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">std::tuple auto x = foo();</pre></blockquote>
Otherwise, the programmer has to remember a bunch of special-cased
rules as to which kinds of declarations can accept an <tt>auto</tt>
or not.
<h3>Return type deduction</h3>
Likewise, just like one can say
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">Constraint auto f1();</pre></blockquote>
one should also be able to say
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">tuple auto f1();</pre></blockquote>
to make explicit that constrained type deduction is taking place (In
	this context, we are using the phrase &ldquo;constrained type
	deduction&rdquo; to refer to the fact that the deduced type
	is given more specifically than just a lone <tt>auto</tt>).
	The example given on top of the table illustrates how this
	can vastly simplify code.
<h3>Argument deduction</h3>
As P1141R0 allows us to say
<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">void auto f1(Constraint auto x);</pre></blockquote>
one should also be able to indicate that a declaration has its arguments
	deduced by
	<blockquote><pre class="brush:cpp">void auto f1(tuple auto x);</pre></blockquote>

This is not only more consistent, but it can help avoid
the need to write function templates where some arguments are dependent as
class templates and other arguments are dependent as concepts. The following
example shows how beneficial that can be (as well as being a
	good illustration of the value of the proposal for partially-specialized
	template argument lists in P1021R0)
